# freebsd-papers
The base for Papers.FreeBSD.org, a collection of conference talks, papers, slides, and videos from conferences related to FreeBSD


To add a paper or talk:
* Create lastname-title.md (based on template.md) in the corresponding year directory
* If there are many talks from the same conference, create a subdirectory
* create a lastname-title.files/ directory beside the .md file to store the attachments
