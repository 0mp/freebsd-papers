After many years using a highly customized Nexenta base OS for the filers serving iSCSI and NFS, Gandi has been looking for modernizing them. A study has been made on various candidates, with strong requirements on performances, fast booting, sta- bility, compatibility with Linux clients and hardware. FreeBSD has been chosen as a replacement. This talk will cover the study, the interaction with the community, the contributions: new tools, patches, bug fixing, testing. it will describe the customization made and the future plan.
