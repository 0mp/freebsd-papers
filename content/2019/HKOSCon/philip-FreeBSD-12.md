This entertaining presentation introduces the FreeBSD operating system and the community that produces it. FreeBSD is an advanced computer operating system used to power modern servers, desktops, and embedded platforms. A large community has continually developed it for more than thirty years. Its advanced networking, security, and storage features have made FreeBSD the platform of choice for many of the busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices.

FreeBSD is the reference implementation for many popular network protocols (most notably IPv4, IPv6, TCP and SCTP) and is used by many operators of critical internet infrastructure. Inexplicably, many people choose inferior alternatives for their services. I explain why FreeBSD is nothing to be afraid of continues to be a very good choice for internet infrastructure.
