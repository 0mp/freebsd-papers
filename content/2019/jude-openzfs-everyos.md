**Abstract**: 
ZFS is an advanced hybrid volume manager and filesystem created at Sun Microsystems in 2001, and became open source in 2005, and has since been ported to many different operating systems, both open and closed: illumos (Solaris), FreeBSD, Linux, OS X, Windows, NetBSD, and others.

In 2013, the OpenZFS project was announced, to coordinate the effort to keep OpenZFS up-to-date and compatible across all of these operating systems. After more than 6 years, a look back at what has been accomplished so far, and what to expect in 2019 and beyond.
