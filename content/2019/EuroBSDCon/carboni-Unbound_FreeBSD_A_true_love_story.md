_This presentation describes how a well-planned engineering project for a **DNS infrastructure** running on a **very big cell phone company** had to deal with unexpected issues from external factors, and how they were overcome with the invaluable help of the DNS software **Unbound**, in conjunction with the **FreeBSD operating system**._

We will explore:

* Numbers and facts from the former DNS service that was running degraded
* Why a local economical crisis changed the plans of hardware/software to be installed by a vendor
* Why triggered the deployment of open source software on recycled hardware by in-house sysadmins
* And why lasted about 6 months without hassle until situation got back to ‘normal’ state.

In the talk we will also see different approaches done on a little physical hardware lab, with the invaluable help of stress testing/monitoring CLI tools, plus well-written documentation like Calomel’s website for doing fine tuning on both DNS software/OS.

_Finally, conclusions and lessons learned are provided to have a starting point with a solid base and provide the necessary tools for new DNS projects._

Pablo Carboni worked as Unix/DNS/Net Admin over the last 2 decades, specially with FreeBSD platforms, and latest times as DevOps. His main passions includes -but not limited to- DNS, *BSD, RFCs, low level protocols, and sometimes as unix developer too.

As an amateur developer (C language specially), he collaborated with Net-SNMP project by sending patches for multi-core CPU usage support under *BSD platforms.
