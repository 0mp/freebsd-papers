Looking at the recent changes to the OpenZFS Project, and how FreeBSD will interact with the OpenZFS Project going forward.

This talk will discuss:

* How the OpenZFS project started
* How the OpenZFS project has changed over the last 5 years
* The introduction of the monthly ZFS Leadership Call
* New problems as ZFS has matured (needing to add a deprecation policy, etc)
* How the OpenZFS project is working to reduce the differences across platforms (command line switches, NFS differences)
* Interoperability improvements (feature flag ‘compatibility’ groups)
* New procedures to prevent divergence and coordinate development across platforms (reserving flags, wider discussion before names for features/flags are decided)

Then switch gears and cover FreeBSD specific issues:

* The switch to ZoL as upstream
* Why we are making the change
* What we get out of it
* How it is better for all of OpenZFS

And finally a status report:

* ZFS-on-Linux and ZFS-on-FreeBSD are now “OpenZFS”
* There is no LinuxKPI in ZFS (kill the FUD)
* What has OpenZFS done for me lately (new and upcoming features)
