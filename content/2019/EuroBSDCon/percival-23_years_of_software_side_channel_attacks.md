I will present a historical review of software side channel attacks, from Paul Kocherâ€™s 1996 timing attacks against asymmetric cryptography to the latest microarchitectural vulnerabilities. While there have been too many attacks discovered to spend time describing every one, I will highlight attacks which were particularly novel or influential, explaining both the history of how attacks build on earlier work and some of the reasons behind the decisions which led to these attacks being possible.

No knowledge of cryptography will be assumed, but the audience may benefit from a basic understanding of CPU architecture (instructions, pipelining, caches, etc).
