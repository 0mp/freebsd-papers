This talk provides an overview of the redesigned routing subsystem in FreeBSD
13. It will cover pluggable fib lookup algorithms, resulting in 10-30x lookup
performance improvements. It will touch on scalable multipath routing and
control plane performance improvements. Basic building blocks â€“ nexthops and
nexhops groups will be covered in detail.
