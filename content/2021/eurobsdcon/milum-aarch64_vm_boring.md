With FreeBSD 13.0-RELEASE, Aarch64 (64-bit ARM Architecture) is now a Tier-1
supported architecture!

Late in the 13.0 development cycle, VMware released ESXi ARM-Fling, a trial
version of their well known vSphere hypervisor, but for 64-bit ARM systems.

All it takes is a Raspberry Pi 4 and the latest FreeBSD Aarch64 ISO to get up
and running, but that wasnâ€™t always the case.

This talk is all about the work that was involved to get FreeBSD and ESXi
ARM-Fling to play nicely with one another, how boring it is to deploy Aarch64
virtual machines in 2021, and the more exciting future fore ARM virtualization!
