This talk is about the ports management team of FreeBSD, also known as portmgr.
It will cover various aspects of daily operation, both interpersonal and
technical, like:

* personnel handling
* deciding on policies
* building packages
* who is who
* history of portmgr
* how things have changed over time (remember GNOME updates?)
* its interaction with other teams
* maybe more.

**René Ladan**

René started to work on FreeBSD in 2004. Meanwhile, he has been awarded both a
documentation and a ports commit bit and is now part of the Ports Management
Team (aka portmgr@). After visiting too many instances of EuroBSDCon, he was
drawn into the accompanying Foundation and now assumes the role of secretary.
