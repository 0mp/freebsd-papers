FreeBSD is often used as a router or a firewall, but the vast majority of tuning guides available for this use case doesn't explain in detail how to calculate each value to be tuned. This study, after describing how to bench a router and the most important basic concepts to understand, demonstrate the benefit of tuning major parameters to obtain the best routing and firewalling performance with FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE.
