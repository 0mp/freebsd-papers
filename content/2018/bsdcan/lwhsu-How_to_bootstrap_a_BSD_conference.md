In this talk we will share everything before/during/after a BSD conference and
the secret behind the scenes. We will also talk about what we learned from
other conferences.

In 2017, we hold a whole new BSD conference in Asia. We choose Taipei, Taiwan
because it is the birthplace of AsiaBSDCon in 2004. The plan was started in
late March and everything happened in 8 months. We recruited a small but
powerful group of experience conference volunteers and had a good conference
for the first year.

We hope these experiences and ideas can help existing conference toward an even
better level, and encourage people hold more BSD conferences.
