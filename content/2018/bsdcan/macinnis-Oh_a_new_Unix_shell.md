Oh is an attempt to reduce the Unix shell's strangeness while retaining its fundamental characteristics. Oh is familiar and recognizable as a Unix shell but with:

* A more consistent and extensible syntax;
* Richer data types, including first-class pipes, objects, and methods; and
* Support for concurrent, higher-order and modular programming.

You love your shell. Youâ€™ve been using it for ages and are extremely efficient with it but there are times when its little quirks are enough to drive you mad. Maybe it's:

* Word splitting turning a file name with spaces into multiple file names that may or may not exist;
* An undefined variable sending rm on a mission to delete all the files in the root directory;
* Having to resort to various workarounds just to write a function that returns a string; or
* Wishing there was some option for importing a module other than sourcing a file and dumping everything into the current context.

You know that because the Unix shell "must satisfy both the interactive and programming aspects of command execution, it is a strange language, shaped as much by history as by design", but the Unix shell feels overly strange.

Oh is MIT-licensed, open-source software and is available on Github

The author currently uses oh as his login, and primary interactive, shell on a machine running FreeBSD.
