The FreeBSD Foundation was founded in 2000, initially to own the FreeBSD trademarks and intellectual property. Over the past 17 years, we’ve grown from being run by 3 volunteer board members, to a team of 9 staff members, and 8 volunteer board members. My presentation will cover a little bit of our history, what’s our purpose, the key areas we focus on and why, and how we are making this a better world, by supporting FreeBSD, the community, and the overall open source ecosystem.

The purpose of my talk is to tell the BSD community about the work we are doing, and what we can do to help them. I will address the key areas we focus on and highlight the work we did in 2017, and why it was important to keeping FreeBSD relevant and innovative. I will have a Q&A session at the end, so attendees can ask questions about the Foundation, and what they'd like to see us working on in 2018. This will be a good opportunity to have a face-to-face dialogue with community members we don't normally get to talk to in person.
