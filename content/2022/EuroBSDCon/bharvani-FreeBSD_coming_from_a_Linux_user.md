This presentation is about a long time Linux user, using FreeBSD and will
highlight some of the personal differences between Linux and BSD, including
using the native tools on either, but also about common tooling.

We will also go over Ansible, scripting and automation used to get the best
result. This presentation is a personal experience presentation and is not a
complete explanation, nor the best solution.
