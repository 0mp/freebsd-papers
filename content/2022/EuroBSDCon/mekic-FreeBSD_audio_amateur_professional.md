FreeBSD has astonishingly good support for audio that is rarely talked about
Although FreeBSD was not created with professional audio support in mind, over
time it became one of the best alternatives out there. In recent years this
operating system received numerous improvements which make it as good as it is
today. This presentation will be about audio advancements made in those years,
what was improved and what is left to do to make FreeBSD event better solution
for audio studios. Presenter will demonstrate his own studio from the view of
FreeBSD and talk about different ways of improving audio performance. Special
care is taken on how not to need specialized hardware or PC intended just for
audio.
