Starting in 2017, but getting into high gear in 2021, I have been leading an effort to speed up the FreeBSD boot process. At BSDCan 2018 I presented work on profiling the kernel portion of the boot process and described some early work speeding up the boot.

In this talk I will describe how I extended the TSLOG framework I presented in 2018 to cover the boot loader and userland portions of the boot process, and give highlights from the work of speeding up the boot process.
