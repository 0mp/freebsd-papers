The FreeBSD Jail isolation mechanism celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2020 and has provided administrators a convenient, lightweight virtualization solution for virtual hosting, package building, and countless administrative support tasks. Of the many Jail management tools available, iocage provides not only management features but also includes a sophisticated|comprehensive Plugins system that provides collections of prepackaged software for a number of roles ranging from personal cloud services, to source control systems, to media servers.

This talk will provide an overview of the iocage Jail management system, a survey of its plugins, and a demonstration of how to create a new iocage plugin.
